# BBB Tracker

A simple project to show Big Brother Brasil data on a website, probably hosted at [bbb.raios.xyz](https://bbb.raios.xyz/). For now it only contains stuff about the 2024 edition.

It is written in TypeScript and it uses Express/Node with a bit of MongoDB to save the data (but only while the show is actually happening, now everything is static). There is also some separate Python code that I wrote to learn the basics about facial recognition, with the intent to track the faces of the participants in real time.
